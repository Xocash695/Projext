This fun new project to show off my rust programming skills by using cool font, text to speech and other things. Note this program currently only works on MacOS because it requires Xcode and runs a shell script. 

Requirments:
- MacOS ( has only been tested verison MacOS 13)
- Xcode with a device simulator (ex iphone 14 pro simulator)
- requires neofetch command installed (can be installed via homebrew)
- requires android studio with a device simulator (ex pixel 6 pro)
- requires cmatrix command installed (can be installed via homebrew)
- requires rust installed
- requires speedest command installed (can be installed via homebrew)

To run this program:
```
cargo run 
```
To Build this program for production: (if you don't want to build for production remove --release tag): 
```
cargo build --release
```
